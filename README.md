BART
====

Implementation of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in JavaScript.

Includes two BART versions:
- The directory StandardBalloon contains the original version, as described in Lejuez et al. (2002)
- The directory PressureBalloon contains a modified short version of the BART, which is inspired by the automated BART, as seen in Pleskac et al. (2008)


Running the BART
----

For running the BART, just open the respective index.html file for one of the BART versions. In addition to the js-script and the style.css file, the jQuery and jQuery UI libraries must be embedded into the .html files for the BART to work.
